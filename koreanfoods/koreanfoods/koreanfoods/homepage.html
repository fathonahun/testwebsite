                        It features finely shaved ice topped with rich chocolate syrup, chocolate shavings, chocolate
                        sauce, and sometimes additional toppings like chocolate cookies, brownie pieces, or chocolate
                        ice cream. The combination of creamy chocolate flavors with the light and fluffy texture of the
                        shaved ice makes chocolate bingsu a decadent and indulgent treat, especially popular among
                        chocolate lovers. It's a delightful dessert enjoyed in Korea and beyond, particularly during hot
                        weather as a refreshing and satisfying sweet treat.</p><span class="price"

                    <h3>Hotteok</h3>
                    <p>Hotteok is a popular Korean street food and sweet pancake that is enjoyed especially during the
                        colder months. It is made from a dough of wheat flour, water, milk, sugar, and yeast, which is
                        then filled with a sweet mixture typically consisting of brown sugar, honey, chopped peanuts,
                        and cinnamon. The filled dough is then flattened into a disc shape and fried until golden brown
                        and crispy on the outside, while the inside remains soft and chewy with the melted filling.
                        Hotteok is often served piping hot and is a beloved treat for its warm, sweet, and comforting
                        flavors.</p><span class="price" style="font-size: 18px">Rp15.000</span>
